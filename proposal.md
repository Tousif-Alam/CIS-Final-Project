# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

WiseBot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot that can do math. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The bot should be able to calculate math when a math problem is entered. The bot should give the correct answers. Features will include basic math such as adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. Being able to solve advanced math problems like exponents, square roots, etc.   

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

By the end of the final project, I want the both to be able to do simple math without any problems. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my final project would be I want the bot to be able to do complicated math problem such as exponents or square roots. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Fully working bot able to do all sorts of math problems such as sine, cosine, tangent, etc. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to create a discord bot. How to set a discord bot. How to manage commands. How to make it user-friendly.
